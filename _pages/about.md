Hello, I'm Bảo Hoàng (called me Hoàng for short), a research assistant in Software Engineering, Computer Science department at [Vietnamese-German University](https://vgu.edu.vn/). I studied and got my bachelor degree of Science, Computer Science in November 2018 at the very same university. I started my internship in [Axon Active Vietnam](https://www.axonactive.com/), an outsource software development company, during the last semester and spent several months after graduation there before decided to move to work in the university as a research assistant in Computer Science department. Influenced by my supervisor, [Assoc. Prof. Manuel Clavel](http://maude.sip.ucm.es/~clavel/), my work has been centered on developing a *model-driven methodology* for enforcing *fine-grained access control (FGAC)* policies on *database-centric* applications. The challenges of this project includes (i) rigorously define such enforcing methodology, (ii) formally prove the correctness of such enforcing methodology and (iii) empirically evaluating the performance of such enforcing methodology. 

**Project progress:** (:man_shrugging:) :heavy_check_mark: :heavy_check_mark: :heavy_check_mark: :heavy_minus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: :heavy_minus_sign: (:man_student:)

**Bottom line:** The proof of the pudding is in the eating and I am still now baking it :-) ...

Additionally, I am interested in Enumerative Combinatorics. In particular, the *Game of Chip-Firing* and the problem of *Pattern Avoiding Permutations*. I did my bachelor thesis on [Critical configurations of Chip-Firing Game on some special Graphs](../files/MyBachelorThesis.pdf) under the main supervision of [Dr. Hương Trần](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huong:Tran_Thi_Thu). Although, it is not my main line of research and my background of mathematics is limited, I sometimes spent free-time on solving some quizzes, provided by Dr. Hương, related to these problems (in exchange for some edible perks :-)). It is very interesting to understand how these studies can be related and applied in practical problems, e.g. checkout this video about [the dollar game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U33dsEcKgeQ) from the famous Numberphile and [the game](https://thedollargame.io/) per se. Also, I believe *Formal Mathematics* is a very promising branch of study. At the moment, I tried to extend my knowledge in this area as well as familiarize myself with the state of the art *proof assistant* (I am using [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/), but [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) is also a very good alternative) in the hope of carrying out the correctness proof for the second challenge of my research.
