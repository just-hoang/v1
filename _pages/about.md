Hello, I'm Hoàng, research assistant in Software Engineering and Programming Languages in Computer Science at [Vietnamese-German University](https://vgu.edu.vn/). I studied Computer Science<sub>(\*)</sub> in Vietnamese-German University (VGU) and finished the program in 2018. After the graduation, I went on to work as a software engineer for a company in Hồ Chí Minh city for a year. Then, I decided to switch my line of career, went back to VGU and have been working as a research assistant for more than a year now. Under the supervision of [Assoc. Prof. Manuel Clavel](http://maude.sip.ucm.es/~clavel/), my work has been centered on developing a *model-driven methodology* for enforcing *fine-grained access control (FGAC)* policies on *database-centric* applications. The challenges of this project includes (i) rigorously define such enforcing methodology, (ii) formally prove the correctness of such enforcing methodology and (iii) empirically evaluating the performance of such enforcing methodology. 

Additionally, I am interested in Enumerative Combinatorics. In particular, the *Game of Chip-Firing* and the problem of *Pattern Avoiding Permutations*. I did my bachelor thesis on [Critical configurations of Chip-Firing Game on some special Graphs](/files/MyBachelorThesis.pdf) under the main supervision of [Dr. Hương Trần](https://dblp.org/pers/hd/h/Huong:Tran_Thi_Thu). Although, it is not my main line of research and my background of mathematics is limited, I occasionally spent my free-time on solving some quizzes related to these problems. It is very interesting to understand how these studies can be related and applied in practical problems. Also, I believe *Formal Mathematics* is a very promising branch of study. At the moment, I tried to extend my knowledge in this area as well as familiarize myself with the state of the art *proof assistant* (I am using [Isabelle/HOL](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/), but [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/) is also a very good alternative) in the hope of carrying out the correctness proof for the second challenge of my research.
